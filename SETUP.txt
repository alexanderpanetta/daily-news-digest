DAILY NEWS DIGEST - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

This is your improved daily news email system. It runs for FREE on GitHub Actions.


WHAT'S IMPROVED
---------------
- Uses RSS feeds exclusively (no fragile web scraping)
- No hardcoded dates - works automatically year after year
- Sends at 7:15 AM Ankara time
- Better formatted emails (both HTML and plain text)
- More reliable - RSS feeds rarely change


COST COMPARISON
---------------
- Replit: $7-25/month for always-on deployments
- GitHub Actions: FREE (2000 minutes/month, this uses ~1 min/day = 30 min/month)


SETUP STEPS
-----------

1. CREATE A GITHUB REPOSITORY

   Go to https://github.com/new and create a new private repository.
   Name it something like "daily-news-digest".


2. PUSH YOUR CODE TO GITHUB

   Open Terminal and run these commands:

   cd ~/Desktop/daily-news-digest
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/daily-news-digest.git
   git push -u origin main

   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.


3. ADD YOUR GMAIL CREDENTIALS AS SECRETS

   In your GitHub repository:
   - Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Add these three secrets:

   GMAIL_USER        = your-email@gmail.com
   GMAIL_PASSWORD    = your-app-password (NOT your regular password!)
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL   = where-to-send@gmail.com (can be same as GMAIL_USER)


4. CREATE A GMAIL APP PASSWORD

   You MUST use an App Password, not your regular Gmail password.

   a) Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
   b) Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
   c) Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   d) Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
   e) Name it "Daily News Digest"
   f) Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)
   g) Use this as your GMAIL_PASSWORD secret


5. TEST IT

   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Click "Daily News Digest" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Check your email!


6. YOU'RE DONE!

   The workflow will now run automatically every day at 7:15 AM Ankara time.


ADJUSTING THE TIME
------------------
To change when the email arrives, edit .github/workflows/daily-news.yml

The cron format is: minute hour * * *

Examples:
- 7:15 AM Ankara (UTC+3): cron: '15 4 * * *'   (4:15 AM UTC)
- 8:00 AM Ankara:         cron: '0 5 * * *'    (5:00 AM UTC)
- 6:30 AM Ankara:         cron: '30 3 * * *'   (3:30 AM UTC)


ADDING/REMOVING NEWS SOURCES
----------------------------
Edit main.py to add or remove sources. Each source uses RSS feeds defined
in scrapers.py.

Current sources:
- NY Times: Top Stories, World, Opinion
- Globe and Mail: Canada, Politics, Opinion
- La Presse: Actualités, International, Affaires
- Axios: Top Stories
- Substacks: everydayai, understandingai, aisnakeoil, darioamodei, sineadbovell
- Podcasts: The Cognitive Revolution, Ezra Klein Show


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If emails aren't sending:

1. Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repo for error logs
2. Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
3. Verify your secrets are set correctly (Settings > Secrets)
4. Try running the workflow manually to see errors

If you want to run locally:
   cd ~/Desktop/daily-news-digest
   export GMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
   export GMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
   export RECIPIENT_EMAIL="recipient@gmail.com"
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
